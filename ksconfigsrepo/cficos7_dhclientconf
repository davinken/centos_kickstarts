# DHCP CLIENT CUSTOM CONFIGURATION
# 06may2014/davidr - Mycompany Lab @ MYUNI
# 12dec2014/revision for CentOS 7
# 25jan2016/revision - add eth0 although it seems not to be used any more.
# 15sep2016/davidr - Change IP of IPA DNS to that of new server caprica.
#
# In order for IPA directory services to work, it is recommended that the
# IPA server itself acts as a DNS server.
#
# "caprica", the IPA server has been configured as a forwarding DNS server, as
# such it only relays requests to the actual departmental servers, while
# complying with the IPA requirement.
#
# As resolver settings are received by the dhclient from the DHCP server
# (external to Mycompany), we must seed the reference to the internal DNS
# via this prepend declaration, so that caprica is not only declared but
# takes precedence over the others; hoever, the daemon should fall back to
# those in case of caprica becoming unavailable.
#
# This file declares caprica as DNS server, prepending it before the
# DHCP-server delivered DNS values.
# Note that dhclient is child of NetworkManager, therefore to enact this
# configuration restart NetworkManager (or reboot the machine).
