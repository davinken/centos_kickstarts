# signs up the current host into the IPA/LDAP domain.
# Similar to join_ipa.exp but this one will add the --force-join option
# to the command, in order to override refusal due to duplicate entry.

# Note that a plain password for LDAP is given here - this script must be
# restricted accordlingly.

# Usage will be (as root on an arbitrary system to be enrolled into IPA):
